# This code initializes a knowledge base with a vector database and vector embedding service.
# It uses the Qdrant vector database and Cohere for vector embeddings.

# knowledge_base.add_knowledge(
#     query_text="What is the capital of France?",
#     payload={"source": "Wikipedia", "category": "Geography"}
# )

# # Example usage(How to use the knowledge base):
# knowledge_base.get_knowledge(
#     query_text="What is the capital of France?",
#     top_k=5
# )


# insert_id = knowledge_base.add_message(
#     chat_id="68584938c0ca4f80419958a9",
#     message={
#         "user": "Alice",
#         "text": "Hello, how are you?",
#         "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"
